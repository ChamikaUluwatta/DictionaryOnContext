## 📖 Overview
**DictionaryOnContext** is a Firefox extension that helps you quickly understand the meaning of words in context.  
Unlike traditional dictionaries, this extension considers the **entire sentence** before providing a definition, making explanations more relevant and accurate.

## 🚀 Features
- Right-click on any word to get its meaning in context.  
- Uses a background service (Ollama) to process word definitions.  
- Lightweight and simple to use.  
- Works on all websites you visit.  

## 🛠 Installation
You can install it directly from the Firefox Add-ons Store:

👉 [Dictionary with Ollama – Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dictionarywithollama/)

2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **"Load Temporary Add-on"**.
4. Select the `manifest.json` file from the project folder.


## 🔧 Permissions
